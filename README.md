Education-welfare website

Project Description:
Education Welfare is a website which will be the platform for institutions and their teachers to register their needy and poor students. And the people who are willing to donate for the students will access the information about those students and will give donations for them. The purpose of this website is to help the students who can’t even afford their primary education. This website will help to increase literacy rate. And this will be the first step to reduce poverty and we want to extend our work for the higher education to help needy students to get education and become able to survive in society. When education rate will be increased, poverty and hunger will be reduced.
The scope of the Education welfare website is that it can be accessed from anywhere in the world through internet which is almost available everywhere.

Brief Description:
Pakistan is facing my problems one of the major problem among them is poor literacy rate. There are many causes behind illiteracy and one of the most biggest cause of illiteracy is the financial problem. If someone does not have the means of sustenance he can never think about anything but food. It is because after getting food we would be able to read and study. And the people who face financial problems and who live under the line of poverty cannot afford their children to study so they send them for work.
Pakistan is a developing country, and illiteracy rate in Pakistan is 49.9%, which is very low as compared to most other countries and poverty rate in Pakistan is very high i.e. 37.5%. And the main cause of illiteracy in Pakistan is poverty, because poor people can't afford their children to send for education.
Even though in Pakistan basic education is not much expensive but poverty rate in Pakistan is too high that people can’t afford even small amount of money to educate their children. 
In our home we can’t imagine the situation that is much worse than the facts and figures provided by media or other resources. 
There are some websites which provide platform to donate for education but they don’t specify the children for whom they are taking donations. Whenever someone visit any website related to donations the first question which arrives in his/her mind is that  to whom my money will be given or how I could know that my donation is going to the deserving children because the websites don’t specify the children for whom they are collecting donations.
Education welfare website will provide a platform where teachers and institutions can register their students who can’t afford educational expenses. The detail about the students will be displayed on the website and also about the teacher and institution. One who want to donate can personally contact them for their satisfaction.
